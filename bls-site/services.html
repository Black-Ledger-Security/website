<!-- PAGE HERO -->
<div class="page-hero">
  <div class="section-tag">Capabilities</div>
  <h1 class="section-title">Offensive Security Services</h1>
  <p class="section-desc">We test the vulnerabilities that live outside your network perimeter. The ones that walk through your front door, call your employees, and manipulate your AI systems.</p>
</div>

<!-- SERVICES -->
<div class="content-block">

  <div id="physical-pentest" style="scroll-margin-top:100px">
    <h2>Physical Penetration Testing</h2>
    <p>Full-scope covert intrusion testing against your physical security controls. Our operators conduct real-world breach attempts using the same techniques employed by sophisticated threat actors: badge cloning, lock bypass, tailgating, after-hours entry, and objective-based operations inside your facilities.</p>
    <p>Every engagement is scoped around specific objectives. Whether the goal is accessing a server room, exfiltrating sensitive documents, or planting a network implant, we simulate the complete attack chain from initial reconnaissance through physical compromise. You receive a detailed report documenting every vulnerability exploited, with photographic evidence and prioritized remediation guidance.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="physical-walkthrough" style="scroll-margin-top:100px">
    <h2>Physical Security Walkthrough</h2>
    <p>A collaborative, overt assessment of your facility security posture. Unlike covert penetration testing, walkthroughs are conducted openly with your security team present. We assess access control systems, surveillance coverage, visitor management procedures, badge policies, and physical response capabilities.</p>
    <p>This service is ideal for organizations that want an expert evaluation before investing in physical security upgrades, or as a complement to covert testing to identify systemic gaps that may not surface during a single breach attempt.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="vishing" style="scroll-margin-top:100px">
    <h2>Vishing Campaigns</h2>
    <p>Voice-based social engineering targeting your personnel. We develop custom pretexts tailored to your industry and organizational structure, then execute controlled calling campaigns designed to test security awareness, credential handling, and information disclosure over the phone.</p>
    <p>Vishing remains one of the most effective initial access vectors in real-world intrusions. Our campaigns measure how your employees respond under pressure, identify the specific types of information most commonly disclosed, and provide data-driven recommendations for awareness training improvements.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="phishing" style="scroll-margin-top:100px">
    <h2>Phishing &amp; Spear Phishing</h2>
    <p>We deliver two tiers of email-based social engineering. Large-scale phishing campaigns test organizational awareness across your entire workforce using realistic pretexts and payloads. Targeted spear phishing operations use OSINT-driven, APT-style techniques focused on specific high-value individuals or departments.</p>
    <p>Both approaches include custom infrastructure, realistic landing pages, and payload delivery. You receive detailed metrics on click rates, credential submission rates, and individual response analysis along with tailored recommendations for improving your human defense layer.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="osint" style="scroll-margin-top:100px">
    <h2>OSINT &amp; Threat Profile Evaluations</h2>
    <p>Comprehensive digital footprint analysis that shows you what an adversary already knows about your organization. We map your external exposure across public records, social media, code repositories, data breaches, and the dark web to build a complete threat profile.</p>
    <p>Executive threat profiling identifies specific individuals within your organization who present elevated risk due to their digital exposure, public visibility, or access to sensitive systems. Every finding is actionable: we tell you what is exposed, where it is exposed, and how to reduce it.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="ai-llm" style="scroll-margin-top:100px">
    <h2>AI / LLM Security Testing</h2>
    <p>Offensive security assessment of your deployed language models and AI-powered applications. We test for prompt injection, jailbreaking, guardrail bypass, system prompt extraction, data exfiltration through RAG systems, tool exploitation, and unauthorized access through agentic workflows.</p>
    <p>This is not automated scanning. Our methodology applies the same structured approach used in traditional penetration testing, adapted for the unique attack surface that LLMs introduce: reconnaissance, direct injection, indirect injection, tool exploitation, and data exfiltration. If your organization deployed an LLM without red teaming it first, you have a gap we can identify.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="deepfake" style="scroll-margin-top:100px">
    <h2>Deepfake AI Social Engineering</h2>
    <p>Next-generation social engineering using voice cloning and video deepfake technology. We test whether your organization can detect and respond to AI-generated impersonation attacks targeting employees, executives, and critical business processes.</p>
    <p>Deepfake-enabled vishing and video calls represent a rapidly emerging threat that most organizations have no defenses against. Our engagements demonstrate the real-world risk and help you build detection and verification procedures before an actual adversary exploits this capability against you.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="redteam" style="scroll-margin-top:100px">
    <h2>Adversary Simulation</h2>
    <p>Our most comprehensive offering. Every operation is custom-built around your organization's specific threat profile and executes the full attack chain: a detailed threat profile report delivered to the client, extensive OSINT and onsite reconnaissance, vishing campaigns, targeted spear phishing, AI deepfake social engineering, physical breach attempts, and network implant deployment. If network access is achieved, Black Ledger proceeds with 24 to 48 hours of internal penetration testing leveraging the access gained through the implant.</p>
    <p>No two engagements look the same. Operations begin with extensive physical and digital surveillance and advanced pretext development tailored to your industry, your facilities, and your people. These engagements are designed for organizations that want to understand exactly how a motivated, resourced adversary would target them across every available attack vector.</p>
